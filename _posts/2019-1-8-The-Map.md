title: The Map
---

To not get lost during the journey, I need a "map" as a guidance. Fortunately there are some really helpful online resources that suggest good paths to study Deep RL. The following resources play very important roles in creating such a map.

[OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/)  
[Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)  
[Neural Networks and Deep Learning book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

A big shout-out to the contributors and authors of those resources! By combining the paths suggested in the above resources, I created the map below.
